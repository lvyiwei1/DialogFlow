The key steps for helping a customer book a hotel are as follows:

1. Ask the customer if they have a preferred location.

2. If the customer does not have a preferred location, suggest a few different options.

3. Ask the customer if they would like help booking a room.

4. If the customer would like help booking a room, ask for the necessary information (dates, number of people, etc.)

5. Book the room and provide the customer with a reference number.
