The steps for booking a hotel are as follows:

1. Hello, I'm looking for some information about places to stay in Cambridge. I would like to know the most inexpensive price range located to the north.

2. There are 2 guesthouses in the area I recommend worth house, would you like me to book that?

3. Does that have free wifi?

4. Yes, both options have free wifi. Worth House has four stars and is really quite nice. Would that work for you?

5. That sounds like a great choice.

6. What day would you like to reserve? How many days will you be staying and how many people will be staying in the reserved room?

7. I would like the phone number, postcode, and star of the hotel

8. Worth House has a 4-star rating and their postcode is cb41da. They can be reached by phone at
