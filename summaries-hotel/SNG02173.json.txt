In order to help a customer book a hotel, you would need to ask them some questions in order to better understand their needs. Some key questions could include:

-Are you looking for a specific type of hotel?
-Do you have any preferences in terms of location?
-What is your budget?
-Would you like me to provide some recommendations?

After understanding the customer's needs, you can then provide them with some specific hotel options that fit their criteria. Once the customer has chosen a hotel, you can then help them with the booking process.
