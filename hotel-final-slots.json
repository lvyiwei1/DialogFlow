What star rating is it?\nService: It is a 4-star rating.\nCustomer: OK, can you just book a 4 star hotel room in the west part of town?  Any one is fine.\nService: Both of these hotels are booked. Would you like to change any of your parameters?\nCustomer: Let me try again.  I am needing a 4 star hotel in the west, for 6 people.  Checking in on Saturday, 5 nights.\nService: That worked, thank you for summarizing for me.  Your reference number is U0E4KO2T.  Is there anything else I can help with?\nCustomer: I need a Hotel type in the west that's 4 stars to book for 6 people for 5 nights, starting on Saturday, please recheck that you can't book that.\nService: I have that all worked out for you, the reference code is MQ7AMF1M. The hotel is the Cabdrife Butterfly.Is there anything else you need?\nCustomer: No, I'm sorry that was so confusing.  It appears I have 2 hotels, but that is better than 0.  Have a good day.
