The key steps for helping a customer book a hotel are as follows:

1. Ask the customer if they are looking for a specific type of accommodation (e.g. hotel, guesthouse, etc.).

2. If they are looking for a specific type of accommodation, ask the customer if they have any preferences in terms of price range, amenities, etc.

3. Once the customer has provided their preferences, search for accommodation options that match those criteria.

4. If the customer is happy with one of the options found, proceed to book the accommodation.

5. Once the booking is complete, provide the customer with the relevant details (e.g. reference code, contact number, etc.).

6. If the customer has any further requests, try to accommodate them.

7. Thank the customer for using the service.
