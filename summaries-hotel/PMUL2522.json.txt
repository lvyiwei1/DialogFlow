PS: I'll assume you want the key steps for helping ANY customer book ANY hotel

1. Ask the customer what type of hotel they are looking for (e.g. star rating, price range, etc.)
2. Use that information to search for hotels that meet the customer's criteria
3. Present the customer with a list of results and ask if they have a preference for a particular area
4. If the customer does not have a preference, provide information about a hotel that meets their criteria
5. Ask the customer if they would like to book a room and provide information about the hotel (e.g. address, postcode, amenities, etc.)
6. If the customer would like to book a room, provide information about availability and price
7. Once the customer has booked a room, thank them and wish them a pleasant stay
