In order to help a customer book a hotel, the service provider should gather the following information:

1. The customer's preferred dates of travel
2. The customer's preferred destination
3. The customer's preferred hotel
4. The customer's contact information

Once the service provider has this information, they can then begin to search for hotels that meet the customer's preferences. Once a suitable hotel is found, the service provider can then book the room on behalf of the customer.
