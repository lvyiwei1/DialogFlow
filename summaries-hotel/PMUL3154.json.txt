The key steps for helping a customer book a hotel are:

1. Ask the customer what type of hotel they are looking for.

2. If the customer is looking for a specific type of hotel, see if the hotel is available and book it for the customer.

3. If the customer is not looking for a specific type of hotel, help them choose a hotel that meets their needs.

4. Make sure to get the customer's contact information so you can confirm the booking.
