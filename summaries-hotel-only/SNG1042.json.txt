In order to help a customer book a hotel, the customer service representative would need to obtain the following information from the customer:

- The customer's preferred dates of stay
- The customer's desired price range
- The number of guests who will be staying
- The customer's preferred amenities (e.g. free parking, free wifi)

Once the customer service representative has this information, they can then search for hotels that meet the customer's needs and provide the customer with a list of options. The customer can then choose the hotel they would like to stay at and the representative can book the reservation.
