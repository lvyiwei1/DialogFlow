The key steps for helping a customer book a room at Alexander's bed and breakfast would include finding out the customer's desired dates of stay, number of nights, and number of guests. The service worker would then check availability for the requested dates and make a booking if possible. If the requested dates are not available, the worker would suggest alternative dates or accommodation options. Finally, the worker would provide the customer with a reference number for the booking.
