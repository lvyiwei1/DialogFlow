1. Ask the customer if they have any preferences in terms of location, price, or type of hotel.

2. If the customer has specific criteria, use that information to narrow down the search.

3. Once you have found a few hotels that fit the customer's needs, provide additional information such as the postcode or star rating.

4. Ask the customer if they would like to book the hotel. If so, provide further instructions. If not, thank them for their inquiry and let them know that you are happy to help them further if needed.
