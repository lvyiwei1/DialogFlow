In order to help a customer book a hotel, the customer service representative will need to ask the customer a few key questions. These questions include:

- What day will the customer be checking in?
- How many days will the customer be staying?
- How many people will be staying in the hotel room?
- What is the customer's budget?
- What type of hotel room does the customer prefer?

After the customer service representative has gathered all of this information, they can start helping the customer book a hotel room that meets their needs.
