The customer service representative should ask the customer:
1. What type of hotel they are looking for 
2. If they have a preferred location 
3. The dates they are looking to stay 
4. How many people will be staying 
5. If they have any other specific requirements 

After the customer service representative has gathered all of this information, they should search for hotels that meet the customer's criteria and provide the customer with a list of options. The customer can then choose the hotel they would like to stay in and the representative can book the room for them.
