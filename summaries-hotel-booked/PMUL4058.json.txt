From the dialog, the key steps for helping a customer book a hotel are:

1. Ask the customer which train route they will be taking and on what day.
2. Find out the customer's preferences for their stay, such as location, free wifi, and free parking.
3. Once the customer has confirmed their preferences, book the hotel for them and provide the reference number.
