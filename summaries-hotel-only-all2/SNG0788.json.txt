1. Hi there. I was wondering if you might be able to help me locate a guesthouse to stay at in town.
2. I found 24 guesthouses do you have a location you prefer or any other requirements?
3. I am just looking for one with free parking
4. All right, the Allenbell is a cheap guesthouse on the east side that might suit your needs.
5. That sounds good. Please book it for 1 person and 3 nights starting on Friday.
6. I have reserved you a room at the allenbell guesthouse for 1 on Friday, for 3 nights, reference number O35QES09.
7. That's all I need, thank you.
8. Enjoy your stay! Goodbye!
