The key steps for helping a customer book a hotel are:

1. Ask the customer if they have a hotel in mind or if they have a price range.

2. If the customer has a hotel in mind, ask the customer for more information about their preferences.

3. If the customer does not have a hotel in mind, recommend a hotel based on the customer's preferences.

4. Book the hotel room for the customer.

5. Provide the customer with the reference number for their booking.

6. If the customer needs transportation to the hotel, help the customer book a train.
