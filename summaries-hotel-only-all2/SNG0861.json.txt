The key steps to help a customer book a hotel are as follows:

1. Ask the customer which city they are looking to stay in.
2. Ask the customer how many people will be staying in the hotel room.
3. Ask the customer what type of room they are interested in.
4. Ask the customer if they have any specific dates in mind.
5. Ask the customer if they would like the hotel to be near any specific attractions.
6. Once the customer has given you all of the necessary information, find a hotel that meets their needs and provide the customer with the reference number.
7. Thank the customer and let them know to enjoy their stay.
